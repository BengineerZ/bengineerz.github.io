This paper addresses the challenge of robot learning in unstructured environments through a novel neural-symbolic architecture that combines the flexibility of deep learning with the interpretability of symbolic reasoning. Our approach enables more sample-efficient learning and better generalization to novel scenarios.

## Key Contributions

1. Hybrid architecture for integrating neural networks with symbolic knowledge
2. Method for extracting symbolic rules from learned representations
3. Performance evaluation in simulated and real-world unstructured environments
4. Analysis of interpretability and human-in-the-loop learning
